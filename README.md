## Synopsis

This web app complements simple online learning platforms, providing students and teachers with a friendly UI for adding, managing and sharing extra learning resources. First iteration will be designed for Ironhack online learning platform, and tested with students of next cohort, in order to provide feedback and implement solutions later on. 

## Code Example

(Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.)

## Motivation

This app is being developed as part of my student project in Ironhack's web-dev bootcamp in Paris.

## Installation

(Provide code examples and explanations of how to get the project.)

## API Reference

(Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.)

## Tests

(Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.)

## Contributors

(Let people know how they can dive into the project, include important links to things like issue trackers, irc, twitter accounts if applicable.)

## License
