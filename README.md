## Synopsis

This web app complements simple online learning platforms, providing students and teachers with a friendly UI for adding, 
managing and sharing extra learning resources. 
First iteration will be designed for Ironhack online learning platform, 
and tested with students of next cohort, in order to provide feedback and implement solutions later on. 


## The Student

A student is trying to understand a tricky concept, a confusing subject or something similar.
He opens the app, clicks on the specific subject, and sees the feed all the resources added by fellow students and teachers. 

Alternatively, the student clicks on a link in his original learning platform, which takes him directly to the subject setion in the app.

He views a resource, votes on it, comments on it, asks a question etc.
Or, he adds his own resource which he found online.

## The Teacher

A teacher finds a great resource from which he thinks students may benefit. He opens the app, adds a resource, possibly comments on it. Simple as that.

Or, he goes over a subject recently learned in class, and answers a question in the comments of a certain resource.

## A Resource
Resources are articles, videos or any other educational media, which helped someone in a similar context (i.e. a student or teacher) get that "Ah Ha" moments in that particular subject.

The view of a resource features a headline, author, timestamp, upvotes, comments (collapsed), url and image?

Each resource can be upvoted and commented on, to allow feedback and "mass intelligence" sorting.

Resources are sorted in the feed by subject and upvotes within a subject.

## The Feed

The feed is the current collection of resources, filtered by subject and sorted by upvotes.
